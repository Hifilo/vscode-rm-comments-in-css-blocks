# remove-comments-inside-blocks README

## Features

"This extension simply goes through your css file and removes any comments that are within selector blocks `{ }`.

I made this to use it once CSS is configured and working as expected. What this does is go and remove all the messy css properties I disabled with comments that I no longer need, without removing external descriptive comments.

## Requirements

None

## Extension Settings

None

## Known Issues

This will remove _ALL_ comments inside the blocks. I have no plans to enhance this further to remove comments with css properties. I made this for myself.
