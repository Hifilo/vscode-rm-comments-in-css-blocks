# remove-comments-inside-blocks README

## Features

This extension simply goes through the active css file and removes any comments that are within selector blocks `{ }`.

I made this to use it once CSS is configured and working as expected. What this does is go and remove all the messy css properties I disabled with comments that I no longer need, without removing external descriptive comments.
